## 1.0 Running your first container
Now that you have everything setup, it's time to get our hands dirty. In this section, you are going to run an [Alpine Linux](http://www.alpinelinux.org/) container (a lightweight linux distribution) on your system and get a taste of the `docker run` command.

To get started, let's run the following in our terminal:
```
$ docker pull alpine
```
Output: 
```
$ docker images
REPOSITORY              TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             VIRTUAL SIZE
alpine                 latest              c51f86c28340        4 weeks ago         1.109 MB
hello-world             latest              690ed74de00f        5 months ago        960 B
```

### 1.1 Docker Run

```
$ docker run alpine ls -l
total 48
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root          4096 Mar  2 16:20 bin
drwxr-xr-x    5 root     root           360 Mar 18 09:47 dev
drwxr-xr-x   13 root     root          4096 Mar 18 09:47 etc
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root          4096 Mar  2 16:20 home
drwxr-xr-x    5 root     root          4096 Mar  2 16:20 lib
......
......
```
Other commans to try:
```
$ docker run alpine echo "hello from alpine"
hello from alpine
```
Try another command.
```
$ docker run alpine /bin/sh
```

Wait, nothing happened! Is that a bug? Well, no. These interactive shells will exit after running any scripted commands, unless they are run in an interactive terminal - so for this example to not exit, you need to `docker run -it alpine /bin/sh`.

You are now inside the container shell and you can try out a few commands like `ls -l`, `uname -a` and others. Exit out of the container by giving the `exit` command.

```
$ docker ps

$ docker ps -a
